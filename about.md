<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from VCU and a Master’s in Economics from Georgia Tech, with a strong foundation in quantitative analysis. My career has been deeply rooted in data analytics, beginning with Freddie Mac’s Capital Markets division, where I worked on complex financial data projects.

I then transitioned into consulting at Capco’s Data & Analytics practice, where I serve as the Knowledge Graph Lead, helping businesses leverage connected data for powerful insights.

I’m passionate about building applications, uncovering hidden insights in data, and solving complex problems—whether in finance, behavioral economics, or even sports statistics. I love to geek out over interesting trends and find creative ways to turn raw numbers into compelling stories.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer and basketball, challenging myself with chess, making music through piano and singing, and unwinding with video games.</p>
