<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I hold a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics from VCU</strong> and a <strong>Masterâ€™s in Economics from Georgia Tech</strong>, with a strong foundation in <strong>quantitative analysis</strong>. My career has been deeply rooted in <strong>data analytics</strong>, starting with <strong>Freddie Macâ€™s Capital Markets division</strong>, where I worked on complex financial data projects.</p>

<p>I then transitioned into consulting at <strong>Capcoâ€™s Data & Analytics practice</strong>, where I serve as the <strong>Knowledge Graph Lead</strong>, helping businesses leverage connected data for powerful insights.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>building applications, uncovering hidden insights in data, and solving complex problems</strong>â€”whether in <strong>finance, behavioral economics, or even sports statistics</strong>. I love to <strong>geek out over interesting trends</strong> and find creative ways to turn raw numbers into compelling stories. ðŸš€</p>
