# About Me

I hold a **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics from VCU** and a **Masterâ€™s in Economics from Georgia Tech**, with a strong foundation in **quantitative analysis**. My career has been deeply rooted in **data analytics**, starting with **Freddie Macâ€™s Capital Markets division**, where I worked on complex financial data projects. I then transitioned into consulting at **Capcoâ€™s Data & Analytics practice**, where I serve as the **Knowledge Graph Lead**, helping businesses leverage connected data for powerful insights.

Iâ€™m passionate about **building applications, uncovering hidden insights in data, and solving complex problems**â€”whether in **finance, behavioral economics, or even sports statistics**. I love to **geek out over interesting trends** and find creative ways to turn raw numbers into compelling stories. ðŸš€
